# RetrocraftHub
RetrocraftHub is a platform for professional networking and job seeking. Some of it's key features are: 
* Authentication: The users consists of two types -  Freelancers (Job Seekers) and Producers (Job Providers).The authentication is takes place consisting of issuing of JSON Web tokens, which serves as the identity of the authenticated user.
* Routes Protection: It is ensured that the freelancers and producers cannot access each others routes, as well as an unauthorized user cannot access the routes created for authenticated users.
* Freelancer Dashboard: It is the default landing page for a freelancer. It displays all the Job Posts created by other producer, the pending connection requests, the Jobs applied by the freelancer and some random blog posts. 
* Producer Dashboard: It is the default landing page for a producer. It displays all the Job Posts created by the logged in producer, the pending connection requests, and a form to Create Job posts.
* Job Post Detail View: This View differs for the Job Owner, a Freelancer and a Producer who is not the Job Owner. The Owner view the Preview/Edit View of this Post, the Freelancers and other Producers view the notice like display, in addition the freelancers have an apply button to apply for the Job.
* Profile Detail View: This View is again separate for Profile Owner and Other Users. The Profile Owner views the Preview/Edit View of the profile page, while others have access to notice-like view.
* Connection: Freelancers and Producers can connect between one another. The Connection request is sent using the connect button on the profile page of the other user. Once request is sending the button is disabled with 'pending' display, and upon acceptance of the request by the receiver, freelancer or producer are added to each others freelancer-connections and producer-connections respectively.
